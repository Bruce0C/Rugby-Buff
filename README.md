# The Rugby Buff

## OVERVIEW

The Rugby Buff

The rugby buff is a basic site to learn about standard rugby union. When learning a new sport as a player or a spectator, common questions about the game are asked. “What’s happening and why” being chief among them. Without going into intricate detail and confusing the user, this site will only cover the roles of players and officials. Giving a basic understanding of the pitch and the rules and laws that form the sport. So as to not include too much detail the site will act as a sign post to the up to date laws and regulations of the sport.

When testing responsiveness through different device sizes, all pages on the are fully responsive to suit the device size. From the navigation bar in the header to the layout of the images, sections and text. After the site was deployed, the devices used to test responsiveness were...

-  Iphone 13
-  Macbook 
-  Ipad

All pages responded as expected.

**Obstacles**
   - When testing the method of using a carousel with a hidden overflow,the images did not react as expected when using different browser. The main problem the site encountered after pushing the code was that the images would morph slightly out of shape and move outside of the sections boundaries when viewed on the Safari browser. A simple solution to this problem would be to include the use of the Javascript coding language. For this reason a simple card layout was used as it guaranteed the images were visible on all browsers and device sizes.

   - Due to the size of the assets the site began to slow down and get a low performance score on Lighthouse. to address this, all images were resized, compressed and converted to improve the sites performance.
