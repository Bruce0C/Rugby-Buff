                        In order to play the sport. A referee is used to ensure the rules and laws of the game are being
                        followed. They work together with the touch-judges to ensure the game is being played fairly and
                        they keep track of the score. Equipped with a whistle, throughout the game a referee will make
                        decisions that will dictate the flow of the game. For instance, calling advantage to let the
                        game
                        proceed or calling a penalty and stopping the flow of the game. In open play, the referee will
                        at
                        times verbally address players who are in danger of being penalised in an attempt to avoid
                        disrupting the flow of the game. For example calling for players to get back onside or release
                        the
                        tackled player. In set plays such are the scrum they will control the position and timing of
                        engagement in a scrum. If players are injured or at a high risk of injury they will stop the
                        play
                        reset the players. Referees have the power to issue yellow and red card in accordance with the
                        laws
                        of rugby. These card are normally given to player whose actions have put others at moderate or
                        high
                        risk of injury. The rules and laws of the game are absolute however the referee may identify
                        circumstances that will increase or decrease the degree of a penalty.

                        Touch Judges
                        Touch-judges can also be referred to as lines-man. They monitor the touch-line and are also
                        used are
                        markers for the attacks and defences positioning. These officials raise their flags when a
                        ball is
                        kicked out of bounds, a player with possession of the ball sets foot on or past the
                        touch-line. From
                        this point the will mark a point for the referee to reset the players and gesture this by
                        raising
                        their flag to the sky and pointing their arm toward the team that will have possession of
                        the ball.
                        During a conversation kick or a penalty kick for goal attempt both touch-judges will
                        position behind
                        the rugby posts. If both raise their flags in the air when a kick is successful, if a kick
                        is not
                        successful they will wave the flags horizontally across their torsos. The touch-judges can
                        also
                        inform the referee's decisions if called upon however all decisions on the pitch are
                        ultimately made
                        by the referee.

                    <p>
                        Set play is a term used when players have to be reset to continue the game. This can be in a
                        scrum or a line-out. In both cases the forwards split from the backs and assume set positions.
                        Scrums put players is a vulnerable position especially the front-row. It is essential both teams
                        understand and listen to instruction given by the referee and execute the scrum in a way that
                        doesn't put players at risk. For example, improper binding, collapsing the scrum intentionally
                        and poor timing to engage are penalised actions. If weather conditions are poor and the ground
                        makes it difficult for players to maintain the proper footing and form in a scrum, the referee
                        will move the scrum to a safer position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a line-out players stand in a single-file line and the attacking team has a player throw the
                        ball back into play. Both side will lift a player referred to a a jumper in the air to win
                        possession of the ball. When throwing the ball the thrower must have their feet on the
                        touch-line and throw the ball in a straight line to give both sides a chance to win the ball. If
                        they throw the ball directly to their team mates the play is stopped and possession is turned
                        over to the opposing team.

                    <p><strong>Open play</strong></p>

                        line-out or scrum. When in open play forwards and backs can position whoever they choose to
                        benefit their teams strategy. When in open play a referee will always look to keep the game
                        flowing whilst ensuring players are positioned onside. Open play is stopped when the referee
                        blows the whistle√å
