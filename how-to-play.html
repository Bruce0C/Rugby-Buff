                    In order to play the sport. A referee is used to ensure the rules and laws of the game are being
                    followed. They work together with the touch-judges to ensure the game is being played fairly and
                    they keep track of the score. Equipped with a whistle, throughout the game a referee will make
                    decisions that will dictate the flow of the game. For instance, calling advantage to let the game
                    proceed or calling a penalty and stopping the flow of the game. In open play, the referee will at
                    times verbally address players who are in danger of being penalised in an attempt to avoid
                    disrupting the flow of the game. For example calling for players to get back onside or release the
                    tackled player. In set plays such are the scrum they will control the position and timing of
                    engagement in a scrum. If players are injured or at a high risk of injury they will stop the play
                    reset the players. Referees have the power to issue yellow and red card in accordance with the laws
                    of rugby. These card are normally given to player whose actions have put others at moderate or high
                    risk of injury. The rules and laws of the game are absolute however the referee may identify
                    circumstances that will increase or decrease the degree of a penalty.

                    Touch Judges
                    Touch-judges can also be referred to as lines-man. They monitor the touch-line and are also used are
                    markers for the attacks and defences positioning. These officials raise their flags when a ball is
                    kicked out of bounds, a player with possession of the ball sets foot on or past the touch-line. From
                    this point the will mark a point for the referee to reset the players and gesture this by raising
                    their flag to the sky and pointing their arm toward the team that will have possession of the ball.
                    During a conversation kick or a penalty kick for goal attempt both touch-judges will position behind
                    the rugby posts. If both raise their flags in the air when a kick is successful, if a kick is not
                    successful they will wave the flags horizontally across their torsos. The touch-judges can also
                    inform the referee's decisions if called upon however all decisions on the pitch are ultimately made
                    by the referee.
