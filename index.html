                        Rugby is a sport that came into being in 1823 England when a football player named William Webb
                        Ellis decided to carry and run with a football instead of dribbling. In 1839, the first ever set
                        of rules were established for the sport and referred to as the Cambridge Rules. Years later in
                        1871 the Rugby Football Union was founded to become the governing body of the sport. The first
                        international match would then be played by England against Scotland.In 1895 the decision to pay
                        players lead to formation of the Northern Union which consisted of
                        twenty-two clubs. This union consisted of 22 club which years later in 1922 would became the
                        professional rugby league level. Finally in 1995 rugby was recognised as a professional sport,
                        allowing players at this level to be payed. Today rugby is played world wide and as a result
                        inspired and encouraged millions of people to take part in all aspects. From spectators, coaches
                        to officials and players.
